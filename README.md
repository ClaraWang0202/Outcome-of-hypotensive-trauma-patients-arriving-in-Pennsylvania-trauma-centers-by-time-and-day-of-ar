# Outcome of hypotensive trauma patients arriving in Pennsylvania trauma centers by time and day of arrival

## Dataset:
The study used data that was provided by the Pennsylvania Trauma Systems Foundation (PTSF) Pennsylvania Trauma Outcomes Study (PTOS) database.
### Background
Although most studies of trauma patients have not demonstrated a “weekend” or “night” effect on mortality, outcomes of hypotensive patients have not been studied. We sought to evaluate whether outcomes of hypotensive patients were associated with admission time and day.
 Time and day of admission were analyzed as four groups:
•	Group 1: Weekday Day (Monday to Friday, 07:00 – 18:59) 
•	Group 2: Weekday Night (Monday to Friday, 19:00 – 06:59)
•	Group 3: Weekend Day (Saturday and Sunday, 07:00 – 18:59)
•	Group 4: Weekend Night (Saturday and Sunday, 19:00 – 06:59) 

## Methods 
We analyzed patients from Pennsylvania Level 1 and Level 2 trauma centers with systolic blood pressure of <90 mm Hg over 5 y. Patients were stratified into four groups by arrival day and time.Adjusted mortality risks for Groups 2, 3, and 4 with Group 1 as the reference were determined using a generalized linear mixed effects model.
Our hypothesis was that there were no increased risk of death during weekends or nights for patients arriving at trauma centers.

## Analysis: 
Cleaned the data base on statistics methods and domain information.
Plotted the variable distribution and interaction to understand the data.
Did power analysis and sensentive analysis.
Implemented a stepwise algorithm to select terms for model.
Built generalized linear mixed effect model and simple logistic regression model. 

## Results
After exclusions, 27 trauma centers with a total of 4937 patients were analyzed. Overall mortality was 44%. Compared with patients arriving during the day (Groups 1 and 3), those arriving at night (Groups 2 and 4) were more likely to be younger, to be male, to have lower Glasgow Coma Scale scores and blood pressures, to have penetrating injuries, and to die in the emergency room. Controlled for admission variables, odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) for Groups 2, 3, and 4 were 0.92 (0.72-1.17), 0.89 (0.65-1.23), and 0.76 (0.56-1.02), respectively, for mortality with Group 1 as reference.

## Conclusions 
Patients arriving in shock to Pennsylvania Level 1 and Level 2 trauma centers at night or weekends had no increased mortality risk compared with weekday daytime arrivals.
